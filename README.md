# Teaching Queue

## Technical Documentation and Setup
This project is an attempt to write a TA queue with a better looking, more reliable, and feature rich system. Starting from scratch, we are building a new queue using standard web technologies. On the front end, the queue is making use of jQuery, CSS5, and Bootstrap. The backend is written entirely using the standard PHP libraries, storing all data in a MySQL database, and utilizing CAS or LDAP for authentication.

### Example Setup
The queue is written to allow for a fairly flexible setup. At the most basic level, the queue is hosted on a standard web server like Apache or NGINX. Additionally, all the data is stored in a MySQL database. Finally, all user authentication and information is handled by an external Active Directory (LDAP) server.

### Web Server
The queue requires a web server for hosting. We have chosen to test against Apache 2.4. However, we are not making use of any Apache specific features/settings, so in theory any web server should be able to host the queue. Since user credentials are being sent over the network, TLS is a must.

### MySQL Server
All SQL code is written using the standard php-mysql library. As so, a MySQL server is needed for all the backend data. At this point in time (2018), MaraiDB is considered a drop in replacement for MySQL, and should work as well. On our testing setup, we host a MariaDB server on the same machine as the web server. However, the code is written so that these two servers are not coupled, and may reside on different machines. In this case, the corresponding SQL port(s) will need to be opened on the machine hosting the database. When the SQL server resides on the same machine as the web server, localhost may be entered for the SQL_SERVER global variable in the config.php file, and no corresponding firewall ports need to be opened for SQL.

### LDAP Server
All authentication and user information is handled by Active Directory using the standard php-ldap library. Because of this, switching to a different Active Directory domain is as simple as modifying the config.php file. All user information is pulled from LDAP and stored locally in SQL the first time a user logs in. Because of the sensitive information going over the network, all LDAP traffic must use TLS. Optionally, authentication can be handled using LDAP by simply attempting to bind to the LDAP server with the given username and password. Lastly, it is important to note that user passwords are NEVER stored anywhere on the server. If LDAP authentication is enabled, the credentials are simply forwarded to Active Directory server.

### Network Ports on the Server
Port 80:   HTTP redirect  
Port 443:  HTTPS  
Port 3306: MySQL (Only needed open if running on different server)

### Dependencies
Apache >= 2.4 (Ealier versions most likely work, but haven't been tested)  
MySQL  >= 5.5 (Ealier versions most likely work, but haven't been tested. MariaDB should work too)  
PHP    >= 7.0 (PHP 7.0.5 or later recommended for utilizing some features of php-ldap)

### Configuration file (config.php)
SRV_HOSTNAME: Name of the server running the queue. Used for CAS logout redirect.  
LDAP_SERVERS: Array of FQDNs or IP addresses of the LDAP servers.  
LDAP_DOMAIN: Active Directory domain FQDN.  
BIND_USER:   User to bind to LDAP with. Simple username, not DN format.  
BIND_PASSWD: Password for BIND_USER.  
BASE_OU:     LDAP OU where all searches start. DN format.  
SQL_SERVER:  FQDN or IP address of the MySQL server.  
SQL_USER:    User to connect to MySQL with.  
SQL_PASSWD:  Password for SQL_USER.  
DATABASE:    Database for the queue.  
HELP_EMAIL:  Email address for support.  
AUTH:        CAS or LDAP (only used for auth, info still comes from LDAP).  

### MySQL Database Setup
In the resources directory at the root of the project is the DB_setup.sql file that initializes the queue database. Simply set the database name at the top of the file to match what's set in the config.php file. In a mysql shell, the script can be ran using 'mysql> source path/to/DB_setup.sql'.

### Swagger API Documentation
The public API is documented according to the Swagger 2.0 specification. The documentation file is found at "/swagger/ta_queue.yaml". CHANGES TO THE API SHOULD BE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY IN THIS FILE. The Swagger webpage is viewed by browsing to "/swagger/index.html" (the Swagger UI version is 3.10.0). The webpage has a "Try it out" feature which allows users to actually use each endpoint. For this to work correctly, the "host" and "basePath" values at the top of the documentation file should point to the desired API (perhaps the real one).

## User Documentation

### Roles
The queue currently has four major roles: Student, Teaching Assistant, Instructor, and Administrator. The first three groups are mutually exclusive, and enrolling in one will remove any previous enrollment in the others.
#### Student
On the Courses page, students may enroll in any course. If desired, Administrators may require an access code in order to enroll in a course, or see any statistics. 
#### Teaching Assistant
Corresponding to each course is a TA group. If a user is in the group for that course, the user is then granted TA permissions for that course, and may not register as a student.
#### Instructor
Each course also has an instructors group. This group currently inherits all permissions granted to TAs, but will have access to a wider variety of statistics.
#### Administrator
The queue also has an administrator group defined. If a user is in this group, the user is granted administrative permissions. In this case, the Admin dropdown menu appears which allows them to create courses.  
NOTE: Administrators also have access to a wider range of statistics. Unfortunately these are not visible graphically yet.

### Enrolling and Unenrolling in Courses
If a user is not enrolled in any courses, either as a student or a TA, they are dropped on the Courses page after login. Here they can enroll in any course by simply clicking enroll. If an access code is required to enter the course, students must enter this before proceeding. This page is also where a student would unenroll from a course. In this case, the user can simply select Leave for a particular course. If a user is enrolled in at least one course, they are dropped on the My Courses page after login. 

### Creating a new course
#### Access Codes
If desired, administrators may require an access code in order to enroll in a course. In this case, the course will appear yellow on the Courses page, and have a padlock icon next to it. Students will be required to enter an access code in order to join the course. Access codes can include any ascii character and be up to 16 characters long. 
#### Assigning and Removing Teaching Assistants
Corresponding to each course is a list of TAs. During course creation/modification, an administrator can set the TAs for a particular course.

### Statistics
Nearly every queue operation is logged. These includes a student's name, course, question, and timestamps for entering, getting helped, and exiting the queue, along with the TA that helped them.  
Currently however, the only metrics that are visible via the web interface are the number of students helped per day for a particular course.  
With this said however, public API endpoints are available that give much more detailed information on a per course, per student, and per TA basis.

### Queue Functionality
#### Announcements
TAs are allowed to post announcements for their course. All announcements appear at the top of the screen, with newer announcements appearing towards the top. Announcements within the fifteen minutes appear in green. TAs can delete announcements by pressing the X button corresponding to the particular announcement.
#### Queue States
##### Open
All students can enter the queue. Students on cool-down cannot enter.  
NOTE: The queue can be open, even if no TAs are on duty.
##### Closed
Student cannot enter the queue, and no TAs are on duty.
##### Frozen
No new students can enter the queue. Students in the queue when it was frozen remain in the queue.
#### Time Limits
TAs may choose to impose time limits when helping students. In this case, TAs can set the time limit using the Time Limit Per Student setting. When a student's time has passed, the row corresponding to that student turns red.  
#### Cool-down Timers
TAs may wish to impose cool-down timers for students. This means that if a student gets helped, they are not allowed to enter the queue again until X minutes after they left the queue. TAs can get the cool-down time using the Cool-down setting.
#### Reordering
TAs may wish to reorder the queue. In this case, TAs can use the up and down arrow buttons next to a student to shift their position in the queue.
