~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ NOTES/TODO ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-SIMPLE WORK AROUND TO 'HOLD POSITION' DILEMA: allow students to move themselves down in the queue
-Make questions optionally visible to rest of class?
-Make 'description' optional for courses? What did we want to use this for?
-Make the 's' dynamic in the 'TA(s) on Duty' box?
-The 'U' logo in the top left of the screen simply takes you to the page you're on. Disable?
-Add tool tips for unnamed buttons in the queue (e.g. the help/free button on the queue page)
-It took up more room, but I think the timestamp could be useful for announcments. Also, should we include names?
-Can a course be taught by two different professors during the same semester? DB won't allow that.
-Some numerical values are returned as strings (e.g. 'time_lim' and 'id' in get_queue.php). Would it make more sense to make
these integers?
-I forget how I even got my CADE credentials in the first place... should we have a link on the login page to some CADE page if
users don't have a CADE account?
-nitpicky thing but might be easier to do in an IDE: change 'class' to 'course' in endpoint names as that matches the code
and API documentation
-Should we have the UI show specifically which TA is helping whom? Maybe each TA can have its own color in the TAs on Duty box.
-help_student.php (not the UI) allows two TAs to help the same student. Keep it this way? I sorta think yes, but how would we show this?
***Similar to all the 'Not a Problem's below, getting the queue for a course that doesn't exist simply returns
'state:closed'. If we decided to explicitly store closed queues in queue_state, we could return that the course
doesn't exist still in one SQL call. Again, this isn't real high priority and is sorta convention. But I think
ideally the messages returned from our API will give accurate info, so the caller of the API doesn't think,
for example, that a queue is closed even though the queue doesn't even exist.
-max on duty TAs box wider so a name doesn't take two lines to display
-make student question optionally visible to other students?
-set Announcements and On Duty TA boxes at a constant size (instead of growing/shrinking) and use scroll bar when necessary
-on All Classes page, color code enroll and leave options (e.g. Enroll=green, Leave=red)
-automatic location generation when entering queue
-TA/faculty toggle abilities (e.g. does logging out remove you from queue)
-Have different background colors for TAs
-Have CIS handle authentication
-Spinners or progress/waiting indicators for slow loads
-Should logging out remove you from all queues?
-Not a Problem: Dequeuing a student from a queue they’re not in returns success. Problem?
-Not a Problem: Removing a course that a student’s not enrolled in returns success. Problem?
What convention should we use? 
-Lock navbar in place when scrolling
-TA/faculty ability to delete announcements
-Consider changing HTTP response status codes for errors to, for example, 400 instead of 200 (200 indicates success)
-NOT IMPORTANT UNTIL END OF SEMESTER: Swagger lets people test the API, similar to Postman. Ideally I think we should
allow people to test all endpoints, including those restricted to admins or TAs. But for obvious reasons, we don't want
Swagger to be messing with the actual DB in use. How do we accomplish this? Set up a sandbox server/directory with its own DB
and point Swagger to that? For each new/updated edition of the API, the sandbox directory would have to be/should be
updated.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ EMAIL FROM ERIN PARKER ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Daniel,
In a meeting with some of my TAs this morning, the topic of the TA call queue came up and I took the opportunity to get
some ideas from them on what they would like to see in a new app.  Here are some notes.  Feel free to ask about anything
that does not make sense.

Done: -Ensure that only students currently enrolled in the class can sign in (with an access code or something). It doesn't
happen much, but occasionally students from the wrong class sign in.

-Include a utility for TAs to directly message students currently in the queue (collectively or individually). This can be
useful if a student's location is incorrect, or to warn that TA hours are ending soon.

-(This is a bit specific to CS at the U, but...)  Have a map of the CADE lab to show where students in the queue are sitting,
so the TA can locate them quickly.

-Include push notifications to the TAs on duty for when a student enters the queue.  During slow times, when the queue is empty,
some TAs are late noticing that a student has entered.

-Allow a TA-supplied list of common issues/questions for students to choose from when entering the queue, to make it easier to
answer for a group of students.

Done: -When students enter the queue, have a "subject" line to fill (in addition to name and location).

-Allow TAs to reorder the queue and undo removing a student.

-Capture a history/activity log for a session, for TAs and instructors to look at later and assess things like how long a TA is
spending with students, which students use the queue most often, etc.
